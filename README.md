# artificial-intelligence
This is a 2d game with python(you should intall all packages firs)
The game has an agent, and there are some boxes and obstacles.
There are some rules, for example, moving each box in step cost 1.
moving 2 or 3 boxes together also cost 1. The environment is n*n square, and the agent's task is to put all boxes out of the environment with minimum cost. So there is a map and code for UI. I tested different heuristic functions in ai.py file .
So you can clone the project and use other functions to get better results.
